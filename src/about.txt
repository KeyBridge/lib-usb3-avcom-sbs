The SBS single board solution was designed from the ground up with the system integrator in mind. 
The compact design measures 5”x7” so that it can easily be integrated into another piece of 
equipment, inside a small satellite terminal, or as an integral part of the satellite antenna 
itself. With no switches to worry about, the SBS can be mounted on the wall, floor, or top of 
a rack. The only thing needed is external power to power the SBS in the range of +15V to +24VDC/9W. 
It can be embedded in to a system design or concealed somewhere for covert signal monitoring 
purposes. The SBS has been embedded and proven in systems built for teleports, Department of 
Defense, and government agencies. It is also been used in Special Forces as well as maritime 
applications. Ethernet/USB/RS-232 connectivity adds flexibility when interfacing into a system.

The SBS is designed for the measurement and analysis of communications and broadcast carriers, 
making uplink, downlink, L-Band carriers, IF, and 10MHz reference signals easy to measure, 
monitor, and store. The SBS provides excel- lent frequency and amplitude accuracy along with 
resolution band-width (RBW) selection from 10kHz to 1Mhz. This is required to allow viewing 
and monitoring of small Telemetry, Tracking, Command Systems (TT&C), data carriers found in 
many satellite communications markets, spread spectrum, and Wi-Fi as well. Making the RBW smaller
is like zoom- ing in on a carrier and magnifying a smaller portion of it to see more detail of 
the signal.Variable reference levels (RL) from -10dB to -50dB make viewing of smaller to larger
signals possible. Zoom provides viewing at -2 dB RL for close up inspection when doing signal 
analysis. This also makes maximizing a satellite dish a snap.

The SBS can provide discrete remote monitoring and control from anywhere in the world. The SBS 
is monitored and controlled using the Avcom Remote Control Software via serial port, USB, or 
Ethernet. The Remote Control Software has an intuitive user interface that is easy to use 
with no special training required. It allows remote monitoring and control from your network 
or over the internet. Features include screen shot capture recording, SNMP for alarm/monitoring, 
markers, and Automated Data Acquisition (DAQ) with tolerance comparison, and integrated email 
alerts to name a few. Up to twelve windows can be displayed at one time. The Remote Control 
Software is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
